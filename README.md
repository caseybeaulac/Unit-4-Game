# Pokemon Catcher

This game is fairly simple, match the target number! The user has 4 different "Poke Balls" to click, each containing a random number from 2 to 10. Every time one of these are clicked, the users number increases by the selected Poke Ball's number. If the user matches the target they win, if it goes over, they lose. Give it a try!
